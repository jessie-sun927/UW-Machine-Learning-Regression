## Week3 Topics:
* Assess performance
  - training MSE
  - generalization MSE/prediction MSE: true obejctive
  - test MSE
* Bias and Variance trade-off
  - Decomposition of expected prediction MSE
* Overfitting
* Model Evaluation Techniques
  - holdout method: for sufficient data
  - Cross-validation method: less data required
  
  


## Algorithms: 
Cross-validation


## Implementation Details of Programming Assignment:

Goal:predict house prices using simple (one input) linear regression

* Write a function to compute the Simple Linear Regression weights using the closed form solution
* Write a function to make predictions of the output given the input feature
* Turn the regression around to predict the input given the output
* Compare two different models for predicting house prices
